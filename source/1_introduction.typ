= Introduction

- Engineering Research has empowered humanity for centuries.

  - Provide examples (mechanics, steam engine, medicine, transistors, etc).

  - Cite history of research, with STEM in mind. (Maybe mention liberal arts?).

- Research _communities_ are extremely diverse.

  - Examples: many concentrations in CS, Math, etc.

  - Discuss pervasive issues in _bridging_ research.

    - Different languages, approaches, even journals!

    - Maybe cite original example of BSM + UDGs, in which combinatorialists
    operate separately from SMT-LIB, even though both can support the other.

    - Another example: My Cryptographic professor and
    a CS researcher that has made a cryptographic tool are not aware of each
    other!

    - My insight: lots of _potential_ for collaboration, BUT
    can be difficult. Cite Madhusdan P. in my first meeting with him, in which
    he said that communities are separate for a reason.
