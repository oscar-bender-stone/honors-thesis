A natural question arises with universal formal systems: _which_ one do we
choose? While we have reflection, what is the criterion for the _base_ theory?
Can this be done?

We will show that, under a restricted notion of transformation, there is an
optimal theory. This will form the encoding under @semantics and provide a
justification for Welkin as this base theory.
