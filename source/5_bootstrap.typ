= Bootstrap

- Provided in bootstrap.welkin file or similar. Main module is welkin, which
  needs to:
  - Provide slates, so inductive definition of binary strings + variables
  - Explain combinators
  - Explain the basics of universal systems. This is very important!
    - Can elide proofs IF there is enough information content.
    - TODO: figure out how proofs might work in this setting
  - Provides syntax and semantics of Welkin itself
- This thesis: will prove that the AST generated from this file
is correct AND that it does, with a suitable interperation bootstrap itself.
- Explain how slates expand the envelope for implementations, BUT ensures
that the final product, the syntax + semantics checkers and the information
organization, can be externally seen!
