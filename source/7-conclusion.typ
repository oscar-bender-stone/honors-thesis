= Conclusion

- Review of thesis
  - Developed slate logic + bi-translation with FOL
  - Developed locally optimal organizational technique
  that can improve based on annotations/certificates
  - Introduced the language, with a straightforward
  graph syntax and semantics
  - Builds upon the last section
  - Bootstrapped standard + used coherency condition
- Significance
  - Backwards AND forwards compatbile standard
  that bootstraps itself. Easy for implementations!
  - Applications to any human subject
    - Sciences
    - Liberal arts
    - Economics
    - Etc.
- Future work
  - Programming language semantics + synthesis
    - Incorporate broader aspects + intent of users! ESSENTIAL for new
      programming languages to be able to discuss pragmatics in some way!
    - Also reproducible AND executable specifications,
    though creating an engine to execute these is far beyond the scope of the
    thesis
  - Organizing large corpuses of human text
  - Numerous applications to AI and improving results
    - Emphasize role of symbol grounding problem in AI
