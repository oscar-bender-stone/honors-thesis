This thesis introduced Welkin, a universal, formalized information language. The
syntax (@syntax) was defined rigorously with a small EBNF, shown to be accepted
by an LL(1) grammar, showing that parsing is unambiguous. The semantics
(@semantics) were provided with several passes to convert parse trees into
units, which contain both a hierarchical and relational structure for scoping
and direct representations, respectively. Units have key properties that enable
them to express any partial computable function @universality-theorem, in
conjungtion with expressing any truth management system, demonstrates
*universality* of the system. This is practically demonstrated by showing that
all the major paradigms in Information Management and Knowledge Management are
expressible within Welkin. Morever, it was shown that there is a way to best
organize the language given available information @information-organization,
showing *scalability*. Finally, the bootstrap in @bootstrap self-hosts the
language within a bounded 64 variant, whose complete Unambiguity (as well as the
grammar's prior) establishes *standardization*. Revisions further enhance this
by

The remaining sections show several areas for future work. This list is not
exhaustive and, by the previous arguments, and can be applied to _any_ subject
with computable representations (essentially, any human subject).

Moreover, the proposed architecture could use an LLM as an oracle.
