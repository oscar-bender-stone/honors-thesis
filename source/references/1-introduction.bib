  abstract      = {In this opinion paper, I consider research at the overlap between information management and knowledge management. Although there is much research that could fit into this area, the boundary of the overlap is poorly defined, and prior work specifically addressing the two topics is more likely to look at their differences than their similarities. Treating this lack of precision as an opportunity, I identify six aspects of the intersection of knowledge management and information management: people, processes, technology, culture, structure and performance/measuring outcomes. These inspire six proposed directions for future research: the extent to which apparently tacit knowledge can be made explicit; the usefulness of semi-formal or informal processes; how to discourage fake content; the implications of working from home; knowledge management and information management in project-based organisations; and how to measure the impact of knowledge management and information management. Suggestions about appropriate theories and approaches for each direction are offered.},
