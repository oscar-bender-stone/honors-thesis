  abstract      = {Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM), as a field, has seen tremendous growth in the last few years. This period was one where many research threads were started and the field was defining itself. We believe that we are now in a position to use the MKM body of knowledge as a means to define what MKM is, what it worries about, etc. In this paper, we review the literature of MKM and gather various metadata from these papers. After offering some definitions surrounding MKM, we analyze the metadata we have gathered from these papers, in an effort to cast more light on the field of MKM and its evolution.}
