e illustrate Welkin with a motivating example: geographic maps.

Consider two travellers, $A$ and $B$, in some landscape $L$. They create their
own maps of $L$, $M_A$ and $M_B$, respectively. They write their own landmarks,
their own paths, and their own regions.

Suppose $A$ and $B$ compare their maps. How do they know they are pointing to
the same landscapes or paths? On the map, they may use distinct or identical
names, but that _itself_ does not determine if they represent the same entity.
This property is called *faithfulness* or *preservation*.

Now, suppose there is another landscape $L'$. How does $A$'s map distinguish $L$
from $L'$? This property is called.

This overarching example demonstrates how two sources communicate about some
entity, or how a source's representation can distinguish between two entities.
