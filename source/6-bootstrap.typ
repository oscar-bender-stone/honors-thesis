= Bootstrap <bootstrap>

// TODO: decide soon whether to include proofs IN the bootstrap!
// Definitely need to finsih those soon, if so
This section proves that there is a file, which we call `weklin.welkin`, that
contains enough information to _represent_ Welkin. We do not bootstrap proofs in
this thesis, but that could easily be a future extension.


== Self-Contained Standard

This section is self-contained and defines _everything_ necessary about Welkin.
The complete bootstrap is in appendix ?.


// TODO: emphasize that Welkin is
// homo-iconic, similar to lisp!
// Very powerful!

#let bootstrap-text = ```
#welkin,



```
