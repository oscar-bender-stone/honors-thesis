== Syntax <syntax>

- Want to include essential components and use slates
for the rest. May incluce lemmas to show *why* these notions are useful (but
make be part of a separate section).
- Scoping: need to avoid collisions! With slates, can expand further and
  generalize to, e.g., nodes with sharing
- Rewrite rules: need the formal system part to
be clear that is ultimately symbolic.

== Semantics <semantics>
- Semantics on AST
  - Terms: graphs
  - For ease of use, include a null node
  that is the root of the tree. This represents the module itself.
- For information organization: integrate with previous section
  - Emphasize how this is a useful tool and can ensure
  *new* information content is being created (at least, that can be distnguished
  from the current module). If already existing, but that doesn't match the
  user's expectations, they need to refine it! OR, maybe it *does* match
  similarly with something else! (e.g., hidden connections between math and
  music)
